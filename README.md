# Sinusoidal_pumping_test_analytic
A short script to analyze measurements obtained by sinusoidal pumping tests. This script is based on the analytic solution developed by Rasmussen et. al. 2003 
Written by Golo Voelker at the University of TÃ¼bingen to simplify and automize the analytical estimation of Transmissivity, Storativity and Diffusivity from Sinusoidal pumping test data
Needed Libarys: Numpy, Matplotlib,scipy
